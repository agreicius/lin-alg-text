  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="s_solving"/> we sketched a procedure for solving a linear system <m>L</m>. That procedure involved applying a sequence of row operations to <m>L</m> to obtain a <q>simpler</q> system <m>L'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section we will fill out this sketch. Specifically, we will
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
          describe precisely what we mean by a <q>simpler</q> system,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            provide an algorithm (or recipe) that decides exactly what sequence of row operations to apply to obtain this simpler system,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            explain how to find <em>all</em> solutions of the resulting simpler system.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
<p>
    Before we embark on these steps, we introduce a useful bit of notation. As you may have noticed, when performing row operations on a system of equations, we essentially treat the unknowns, as well as the plus and equals symbols, as placeholders; the only things that actually change in a given step are the coefficients in the equations. The <em>augmented matrix associated to a linear system</em> is a formal way of extracting just the information of the coefficients from a linear system. Of course, to be official, we should first define what a matrix is.

  <title>Row echelon matrices</title>
 <p>
   Here is our precise formulation of a <q>simple</q> linear system; it is a system whose associated augmented matrix is in <em>row echelon form</em>, as described below.
</p>
<definition xml:id="d_row_echelon">
  <title>Row echelon form</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>zero row</term> of a matrix, is a row whose entries are all equal to zero; a <term>nonzero row</term> is a row that contains at least one nonzero entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A matrix is in <term>row echelon form</term> if the following conditions hold.
      <dl>
        <li><title>(i)</title>
        <p>
        In any nonzero row the first (i.e., leftmost) nonzero entry is equal to one. A <term>leading one</term> of a matrix is such an entry: i.e., an entry of a row that is equal to one, and that is also the first nonzero entry of that row.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><title>(ii)</title>
    <p> All zero rows are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><title>(iii)</title>
            <p>
              Given any two nonzero rows in the matrix,
              the leading one of the lower row occurs strictly to the right of the leading one of the row above it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        A matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term>
        if in addition to conditions (i)-(iii) it also satisfies the following condition.
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>(iv)</title>
            Any column of the matrix that contains a leading one of the matrix in one of its rows . In other words, if a column contains a leading one, then that is the only nonzero entry of that column.
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In practice to decide whether a matrix is in in (reduced) row echelon form,
    follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First verify whether all zero rows are at the bottom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each nonzero row,
          determine whether the first nonzero entry is a 1, and put a box around it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure your boxes make a staircase pattern.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (For reduced row echelon form only.) Decide whether each column with a box has 0's everywhere else.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

            Below you find the matrix with leading ones boxed. This matrix fails to be in row echelon form (and hence also reduced row echelon form) for a variety of reasons: the zero rows are not all grouped at the bottom; the first row is nonzero, but does not have a leading one; the leading one of the fourth row is to the left of the leading one of the leading one in the row above it.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Below you find the matrix with leading ones boxed. This matrix is in row echelon form: the zero rows (rows 4 and 5) are grouped at the bottom; each nonzero row has a leading one (boxed in the matrix below); the leading ones step strictly to the right as we move down the rows.
            <me>
              \begin{bmatrix}\boxed{1}\amp 0\amp 0\amp -3\amp -7\\

            </me>
          The matrix is <em>not</em> in reduced row echelon form, as the last column contains a leading one in its third row, and a nonzero entry in its first row.

      So how do we get <em>ALL</em> solutions,
      and describe them in a useful way?
      Here's how
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Divide the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \dots,
            x_5</m> into <term>leading variables</term>
            and <term>free variables</term>:
            a leading variable is one corresponding to a column of the row reduced matrix that contains a leading 1;
            a free variable is any variable that is not a leading one.
            In our case, <m>x_1, x_3</m>,
            and <m>x_5</m> are leading, and the rest, <m>x_2, x_4</m> are free.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The free variables act as <term>parameters</term> for our solutions.
            They range independently over all reals.
            Give them parameter names: <m>x_2=s</m>, <m>x_4=t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Solve for the remaining leading variables in terms of the parameters <m>s, t</m>,
            starting from the rightmost leading variable and working backwards (
            <q>backwards substitution</q>).
            We find <m>x_5=2</m>, <m>x_3=-6+7=1</m>, <m>x_1=7-2s-3t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the <term>general solution</term>
      of the system is <m>(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_5)=(7-2s-3t,
      s, 1, t, 2)</m>, where <m>s,t</m> can be any real numbers.

      Some comments about how we express the solutions to a system.
      I described the <em>general solution</em> in <em>tuple form</em>:

      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively we can give <em>parametric equations</em>
      for each variable separately:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{lcl} x_1=7-2s-3t\\ x_2=s\\ x_3=1\amp  \amp s,t\in\R \\ x_4=t\\ x_5=2\amp \amp \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we can also just write down the
      <em>set of all solutions</em>:
      <me>
        S=\Bigl\{(7-2s-3t, s, 1, t, 2) \colon s,t\in\R\Bigr\}
      </me>.

      Get used to using all three forms of answers.

      When can this happen?
      As always, it all depends on the shape of the row echelon matrix we get after Gaussian elimination.
      Here is a row echelon matrix whose corresponding linear system has no solutions:
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix}1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 3\\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last equation of the corresponding linear system would read <m>0x_1+0x_2+0x_3=1</m>,
      or <m>0=1</m>.
      Since this is impossible, there is no solution to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can express this succinctly in terms of leading 1's.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A linear system is inconsistent if and only if its augmented matrix reduces to a row echelon matrix with a leading 1 in the <em>last column</em>.

      We are now in a position to fully describe what solution sets to linear systems look like qualitatively.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Gaussian elimination theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Fix a linear system in <m>n</m> unknowns <m>x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n</m>,
          let <m>A</m> be its corresponding augmented matrix,
          and let <m>U</m> be the row echelon matrix we get after applying Gaussian elimination to <m>A</m>.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The system is inconsistent if and only if the <em>last column</em>
              of <m>U</m> has a leading 1.
              In this case there are <m>0</m> solutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume the system is consistent.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If all variables are leading variables,
                  then after back substituting,
                  we find there is a unique solution.
                  That is, in this case there is <m>1</m> solution.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If there is a free variable, say <m>x_i</m>,
                  then since we can set <m>x_i=t</m> for any <m>t</m>,
                  there are <m>\infty</m>-many solutions
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In particular, we see there are only 3 choices for the
          <em>number of solutions</em>
          to a linear system: 0, 1, or <m>\infty</m>-many!

    <title>Solutions to homogenous systems</title>
    <p>
      Consider the special case of a homogenous system
      <me>
        \homsys
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>(x_1,x_2,\dots,
      x_n)=(0,0,\dots, 0)</m> is a solution to this system.
      Thus a homogenous system is always consistent! (Alternatively,
      convince your self that the corresponding row echelon matrix <m>U</m> for the system will have no leading 1's in the last column.)

    <title>Solutions to homogenous systems</title>
    <p>
      Since a homogenous system is always consistent,
      the theorem from before boils down to the following:
    </p>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Fix a <em>homogeneous</em> linear system in <m>n</m> variables.
          There are two possibilities:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                if all the variables are leading variables,
                then the system has a unique solution (i.e., <m>1</m> solution);
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                if there is a free variable, then the system has <m>\infty</m>-many solutions.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
  </paragraphs>
  <!-- <paragraphs>
    <title>Solutions to homogeneous systems</title>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we have:
    </p>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Fix a homogeneous linear system.
          If the system has more variables than equations,
          then there are <m>\infty</m>-many solutions.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since any homogeneous system is consistent.
        We need only show there is a free variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>m</m> be the number of equations,
        or equivalently, the number of rows of the augmented matrix.
        By assumption <m>m\lt n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the definition of a leading 1 implies that there can be <em>at most</em>
        <m>m</m> leading 1's, since there is at most one leading 1 per row.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies there are at most <m>m</m> leading variables,
        and thus at least <m>n-m</m> free variables.
        Since <m>n-m>0</m> there is at least one free variable,
        and thus <m>\infty</m>-many solutions.
      </p>
