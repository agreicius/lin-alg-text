<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In our study of matrices, we have seen that operations from real number arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication) have “analogues” in the world of matrices (matrix addition, matrix subtraction, matrix multiplication).</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The question naturally arises as to what other types of mathematical objects (besides real numbers or matrices) admit analogous operations, and further, what we can say about these analogous systems.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A common technique in mathematics to help investigate such questions, is to distill the important properties of the motivating operations into a list of <em class="emphasis">axioms</em>, and then attempt to prove statements about any system of operations that satisfies these axioms.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We now embark on just such an endeavor. In the current setting we are concerned with two important operations defined on matrices: matrix addition (\(A+B\)) and scalar multiplication (\(cA\)). As you recall from <a href="c_linear_systems.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Linear systems of equations">Chapter 1</a>. <a href="ss_matrix.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.4: Matrix arithmetic">Section 1.4</a>, these two operations satisfy many useful properties: e.g, commutativity, associativity, distributivity, etc.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We <em class="emphasis">axiomatize</em> this setting by considering <em class="emphasis">any</em> system admitting two operations like this: our axioms will stipulate the existence of these two operations, as well as the fact that the operations satisfy the relevant properties (commutativity, associativity, etc.). A system satisfying these axioms is called a <em class="emphasis">vector space</em>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ss_vectorspace.html#paragraphs-79">in-context</a></span>
